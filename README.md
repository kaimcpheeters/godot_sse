## Getting Started

1. **Starting the SSE Server**: Before running the Godot game, ensure the SSE server is running. Navigate to the project root and run:

   ```bash
   node sse_server.js
   ```

   The server should then be running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

2. **Running the Godot Game**: Once the SSE server is up and running, you can start the Godot game as you normally would. It should log SSE events.
